  Hello! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
More about me? I'll be graduating this May with an M.S. in Global Health from [The Duke Global Health Institute](https://globalhealth.duke.edu/). It's a research-based program, and my thesis project focused on cervical cancer prevention in rural Western Kenya. I'm also working on a [mediation analysis project](../../blog/2023-03-27-notes-on-mediation-analsis-in-r/) looking at an intervention for psychotic disorders in Tanzania. To keep my coding skills sharp, I'm working as a Teaching Assistant for the course [Data Visualization in R](https://ericpgreen.github.io/glhlth562/) taught by Dr. Eric Green. 

While my masters work has largely focused on epidemiology, data analysis, and reproductive health, I also have an eye for the visual and arty side of things. In 2020, I completed a certificate in UX/UI Design @ Georgia Tech. You can see [my portfolio here](/project/).

To keep working backward, I completed a B.S. in [Materials Engineering @ Georgia Tech](https://www.mse.gatech.edu/) in 2018. While I loved the education process of becoming an engineer, I wanted to find a field that gave me a strong sense of emotional connection to the work. I'm lucky to have stumbled into [Global Public Health](https://www.mphonline.org/what-is-global-public-health/). 

From engineering, to digital design, to health data science, I've always loved working on challenging and important problems.

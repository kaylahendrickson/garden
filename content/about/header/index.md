<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a graduate student at the Duke Global Health Institute. My thesis project focused on cervical cancer prevention in rural Western Kenya. I'm also working on a mediation analysis project looking at an intervention for psychotic disorders in Tanzania. To keep my coding skills sharp, I'm working as a Teaching Assistant for the course Data Visualization in R. I'll be gradauting with my M.S. in May and am excited to start working in Global Public Health.

Though my masters work has largely focused on data analysis, I also have an eye for the design side of things. In 2020, I completed a certificate in UX/UI Design @ Georgia Tech.

  Hi! Thanks for dropping by my digital garden.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
More about me, you ask? I'll be graduating this May with an M.S. in Global Health. It's a research-based program, and my thesis project focused on cervical cancer prevention in rural Western Kenya. I'm also working on a mediation analysis project looking at an intervention for psychotic disorders in Tanzania. To keep my coding skills sharp, I'm working as a Teaching Assistant for the course Data Visualization in R. 

While my masters work has largely focused on epidemiology, data analysis, and reproductive health, I also have an eye for the visual and arty side of things. In 2020, I completed a certificate in UX/UI Design @ Georgia Tech. You can see my portfolio in the UX Design tab.

To keep working backward, I completed a B.S. in Materials Engineering @ Georgia Tech in 2018. 

From engineering, to digital design, to health data science, I've always loved working on challenging and important problems.

### Thoughts on sort-of giving up alcohol.

---

One thing about me...I really like my N of 1 experiments. 

That is, I like experimenting with my own lifestyle and observing the different outcomes. 

Now, to be transparent, I'm not as systematic and strict as I could be. There is a wild amount of error when I decide to shift a specific variable of my life. When I was vegan, I probably wasn't eating animal products 99% of the time, but I also wasn't scouring every food label for the barest hint of added milk. It's just not in my personality to do so. 

At the same time, I believe deeply in reality. I believe that our actions have specific consequences, whether we choose to see them clearly or not. And I think long term health is one place humans tend to employ a lot of cognitive dissonance and denial. 

I'm no exception. I have a list of back-burner changes I believe I'll start making to my habits tomorrow (always tomorrow). One of my worst habits, from a health point of view, is my tendency to stay up late reading. When I'm doing it, it's always _the last time_ I'm going to do it for awhile, and that's what justifies the sacrificed hours of rest. It's okay because I'll make it up _tomorrow_ (always tomorrow!!!). 

So back to alcohol. This had been my mindset with drinking for a couple of years now.

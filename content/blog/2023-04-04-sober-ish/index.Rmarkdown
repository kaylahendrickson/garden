### Thoughts on sort-of giving up alcohol.

---

One thing about me...I really like my N of 1 experiments. 

That is, I like experimenting with my own lifestyle and observing the different outcomes. 

Now, to be transparent, I'm not as systematic and strict as I could be. There is a wild amount of error when I decide to shift a specific variable of my life. When I was vegan, I probably wasn't eating animal products 99% of the time, but I also wasn't scouring every food label for the barest hint of added milk. It's just not in my personality to do so. 

At the same time, I believe deeply in reality. I believe that our actions have specific consequences, whether we choose to see them clearly or not.

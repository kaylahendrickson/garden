### Thoughts on sort-of giving up drugs & alcohol.

---

One thing about me...I really like my N of 1 experiments. 

That is, I like experimenting with my own lifestyle and observing the different outcomes. 

Now, to be transparent, I'm not as systematic and strict as I could be. There is a wild amount of error when I decide to shift a specific variable of my life. When I was vegan, I probably wasn't eating animal products 99% of the time, but I also wasn't scouring every food label for the barest hint of added milk. It's just not in my personality to do so. 

At the same time, I believe deeply in the tyranny of reality. I believe that our actions have specific consequences, whether we choose to see them clearly or not. And I think long term health is one place humans tend to employ a lot of cognitive dissonance and denial. 

I'm no exception. I have a list of back-burner changes I believe I'll start making to my habits tomorrow (always tomorrow). One of my worst habits, from a health point of view, is my tendency to stay up late reading. When I'm doing it, it's always _the last time_ I'm going to do it for awhile, and that's what justifies the sacrificed hours of rest. It's okay because I'll make it up _tomorrow_ (always tomorrow!!!). 

So back to alcohol. This had been my mindset with drinking for a couple of years now. I haven't been a heavy drinker since my early-to-mid twenties, but I do enjoy the occasional craft IPA. The trouble is how flexible and fickle the word 'occasional' can be. What starts as a truly every once in awhile treat slips into a 3-5 times a week habit, with the constant companion thought of "well it's only this week." 

Now, to be clear, I'm not trying to dramatize having a few drinks a week. I'm also not trying to shame anyone who does so. I consider drugs and alcohol neutral substances, and it's us, the humans, with our unexamined emotions and dishonest intentions, that can turn them into dangerous influences. I feel the same way about pharmaceutical drugs. Context is everything. 

For me, the context is that my intentions around drinking and my actions rarely aligned, even if that misalignment appears small, depending on your personal experience with alcohol. 

Then, one day, pretty randomly, I decided I was done. Ish.

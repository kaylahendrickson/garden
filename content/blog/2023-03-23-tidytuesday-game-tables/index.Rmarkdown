#### This started was one of my first Tidy Tuesday's and my introduction to the gt and gtExtras packages.

As this was an early #TidyTuesday, I went for a fairly simple analysis, and found the 10 highest and 10 lowest ranked board games.  I added on the year the board games came out and the average user ratings. As I recall, this mostly went smoothly, and it wasnâ€™t until I tried the bar plots in the fifth column that I had to open 27 browser tabs. Extensive Googling led me to the gtExtras package, which has the function gt_plt_bar_pct(). This simplified the plotting massively, and the only other thing I needed to do was make scaled average rating to use in that column.

The other major learning point for me was the table styling. I found it surprising that you have to target each piece of the table separately (right?) to style it, but after realizing that the colors and font came together.

  description: "I stumbled upon the idea of a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) while researching how to build a website through [Hugo and blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). Ideally, gardens are organized by ideas and context, rather than the 'stream' of reverse chronological order (like blogs, social media, etc.). My posts are still organized by time as I'm going to have to stretch my web dev skills to get to my desired architecture. However, the notes and essays here are published as they are being written, rather than only when they are polished and complete. 
  
\n \n In sum, lots of growing, occasional pruning (and so many garden-related puns left to uncover). "

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
